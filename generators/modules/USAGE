Description:
    This sub-generator is to be used by Greencode modules, so they can access the
    main Greencode configuration and variables.

Example:
    This sub-generator is not meant to be used directly.

You can compose this sub-generator from a Greencode module, which is itself a generator,
using:

var configuration = {'moduleName': 'my-own-generator'};

templates: function() {
    this.composeWith('greencode:modules', { options: {
        configuration: configuration }});
  }
